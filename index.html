<h1>Bear Trap 101</h1>
<p>Below, you will find everything you need to know to succeed and earn the most points during bear trap. We will go over how to run a perfect rally, join rallies the right way, and basically how the whole thing runs.</p>

<h2>When to Call Your Rally</h2>
<p>First, let’s discuss calling a rally. Each player will be assigned to a quadrant. You will call a new rally every 5ish minutes (depending on your march time).</p>

<p>So each quadrant will call its first rallies as follows:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Front row</td>
			<td>30:00 min</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Quadrant A</td>
			<td>29:30 min</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Quadrant B</td>
			<td>29:00 min</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Quadrant C</td>
			<td>28:30 min</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Quadrant D</td>
			<td>28:00 min</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>The times listed are those left of bear trap so you can use the timer below the trap as a guide to when you should call your rally. As soon as your rally returns home, start another one, so you stay within your quadrant.</p>

<p>Now you may ask, why does it matter when I call my rally? To put it in simple terms, we want to space out our rallies to avoid waiting 5 minutes for our marches to return. This will allow us to join way more rallies.</p>

<p>The first set of rallies will take 5 minutes to return, but once your marches come back, you would <strong>join the top rally</strong>, which would be leaving a lot earlier than the rally you just came back from.</p>
    

<h2>Calling Your Own Rally</h2>

<p><strong>Use your strongest heroes for your own rallies.</strong></p>

<p>Recommended heroes are Mia, Gwen, Hector/Jeronimo.</p>

<p>Instructions on how to set up and save your troop formations are below.</p>

<p><strong>Your top 3 heroes will default into the formation slots.</strong></p>

<p>Note: Hector has a special skill that grants Marksman 10% - 50% additional damage. He’s a great hero to invest in for arena and bear trap lead. You can get his shards from the Lucky Wheel.</p>

<p>Next, we want to change our troop ratio. Tap on Balance.</p>

<p><strong>Your troop ratio should be: 1% / 29% / 70%</strong></p>

<p>Note: If you are using the Snow Ape skill to increase your march size for the rallies you lead, update the balanced troops after activating pet skills.</p>

<p>Make sure to press Save and save it in slot 1.</p>

<h2>Joining Rallies the Right Way</h2>

<p>So we will be implementing a few new rules to give everyone the best chance at getting a good score.</p>

<p>First, let's review our hero selection. We currently have 6 heroes you can choose from to lead your rallies. The hero’s are Reina, Jessie, Jasser, Seo-yoon, Jeronimo and Gwen.</p>

<p>The big question is, why these heroes? Let me show you.</p>

<p>When you view a rally, you can see all rally stats and bonuses by tapping on the little orange flag button.</p>

<p>What we are interested in, for bear trap damage, are the Hero Skills. As a Rally Captain, your top hero’s Expedition Skills are the skills being triggered during the attack. (Exploration Skills are used in the arena).</p>

<p>Each rally gets an additional four (4) Expedition Skills from joining players. These skills are selected by who joins the rally first, to whose leading hero has the most stars.</p>

<p>If your hero is selected to be a rally bonus, the skill must be either additional damage or attack. <strong>The bonus skill is the first Expedition Skill of your lead hero.</strong></p>

<p>Above you can see that Jessie adds 25% more damage to all troops. On the right, you can see that this is Jessie’s first Expedition Skill. All other skills don’t matter at this point.</p>

<p>This is why it’s so important for everyone to select the correct hero leads. If you send Charlie (with a level 5 first expedition skill) as your lead, he will grab a buff slot, and cannot be replaced. The rally will be pretty good at mining coal, but no better at damaging the bear. Everyone in that rally will do 25% less damage than they would have, had Charlie not crashed the party.</p>

Let's Meet our Rally Heroes
Just like I explained above, only the first expedition skills are used as a rally bonus. To select your heroes look at your hero skills. Below are the stats for a level 5 skill. If you don’t have your skills updated to level 5, it’s a good time to go back and see which of the below heroes you can upgrade to make them as strong as possible to fight that bear.
Grab a pen and paper so you can make a note of the heroes with the strongest damage and attack percentage, so you don’t have to jump Jasser back and forth later when setting up the troop formations.

Using Troop Formations
If you aren’t using them already, troop formations will be your new best friend when it comes to bear trap. Once you have them set up all you have to do is press the flags at the top and join your rallies.
Let's set up your first troop formation. You should have your list of heroes you wrote down above. Next, tap on your profile picture at the top left. Then at the bottom tap on Troops and on the next screen tap on Squad.
You will see something similar to the image on the right. Let’s clear your heroes by pressing the small red icon (top right corner) of your first hero.
Tap on the first plus (+) to open another window. Select the first hero on your list and press Assign.
Note: since we are using smaller troop formations you will only need the leading hero.
Once you see that your hero appeared in the first box, press the little x or anywhere outside of the box to make the box disappear.
Let’s change your troop numbers. We want to make sure that 15 players fit into each rally. So we are reducing our troop numbers to 74,000 maximum.
Troops:
15,000 Infantry 
22,000 Lancers 
37,000 Marksmen
When it looks similar to the image on the right, tap Save at the bottom. Select the slot you want to save it in (I am saving this one in slot 2). Tap Confirm.
Your flag should have turned yellow at the top showing that the formation has successfully been saved.
You do not need more than 4 joining formations, and 3 is really enough. Joining a rally without heroes does not significantly affect your damage.
Repeat until you have all your formations set.
Please note, that if you don’t have enough heroes to fill your available marches it is better to send a march with no heroes.
This is what your troop formation with no heroes would look like.

The Perfect Bear Trap
STEP 1:
Make sure you activate Pet Skills.
- Titan Roc - reduces bear health
- Snow Leopard (optional) - increase your march speed
- Cave Lion - increase troop attack
- Snow Ape - increase squad capacity (for lead rally only) 
- Iron Rhino - increase rally capacity
- Saber-tooth Tiger - increase troops’ lethality
STEP 2:
Make sure your troop formations are set up. Set your balances to 20%/30%/50%. When you are the last joining a rally, with less than the 74,000 troops needed to fill, doing a quick Balance before deploying will prevent you from sending mostly Infantry.
STEP 3:
Check what quadrant you are in and when to call your first rally.
STEP 4:
When Bear Trap starts make sure you join rallies from the top. Do not skip rallies to join whale rallies, you score more by joining more rallies. We need to make sure that each rally has 15 players in it. To join a rally with your troop formation, tap on the green plus (+) button and click on flag 2 at the top.
If it comes back empty of heroes, go to your next stored formation to see if those heroes have returned to be redeployed... or just go ahead and send it as a no-hero rally with the proper number of troops. You want all your marches out, heroes or not, at all times.
If you are the last to join a rally rebalance your troops to 20%/30%/50% before sending.
STEP 5:
Call your rally when your quadrant comes up. Same idea as before, click on the trap and tap Rally. Select your first troop formation and make sure that your troop ratio is 1%/29%/70%.
Note: You are responsible for creating the best rally you possibly can. What we mean by that is, to keep an eye on your rally. If someone sends more than 74,000 troops or uses a wrong lead hero it's your job without shame to kick them from your rally. They will be able to join another rally with the correct hero and troops. Please let an R4 know so we can help them get it right.
STEP 6:
This way only the first 5 minutes will be slow. Your troops will come back a lot more frequently so keep an eye on your marches and join the next rallies right away. We need each rally to have 15 participants.
STEP 7:
Don’t forget to have FUN!! Please ask an R4 if you have any questions. We are always happy to help. 

Thank you to Fire Queen for bringing this to us, tried and tested, from her alliance in state #416
